I want to add new enchantments unique to Modern Companions.

These enchants will be strictly for gar given to companions.

The enchants will have 3 (I-III) level increments.

The Enchants will grant the wearer (Companion) increased attributes.

One Enchant for Strength
One Enchant for Dexterity
One Enchant for Intelligence
One Enchant for Endurance

The Strength Enchant/Book will be named; Empower
The Dexterity Enchant/Book will be named; Nimbility
The Intelligence Enchant/Book will be named; Enlightenment
The Endurance Enchant/Book will be named; Vitality

Stage 1 of these enchants will add +1 to the respective attribute
Stage 2 will add +2
Stage 3, +3

When enchanted on armor and then equipped by a Companion, it will add the respective values to their respective attributes and recalculate their stats (Health, Damage, Speed, etc) - unequipping the armor with the enchants will subtract the attributes and recalculate again.
