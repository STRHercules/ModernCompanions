- 2025-11-18: Next, port original Human Companions content into the new NeoForge 1.21.1 scaffolding—migrate registries (entities/items/structures), networking, configs, and assets under `modern_companions`, then add README and run a full Gradle build once the code is in place.
- 2025-11-18 (later): Finish porting gameplay logic (entities/AI, networking, GUIs, structure placement) onto the new registries; add data-driven assets under the new namespace once binary inclusion is allowed, then verify with a Gradle build.
- 2025-11-18 (further): Next still to-do—port GUI toggle controls and networking for patrol/alert/hunt/stationary flags, migrate companion house worldgen data/logic, and run a full Gradle build/validation once core behaviors are complete.
- 2025-11-18 (network prep): Wire upcoming GUI buttons to the new toggle-flag packet so player interactions sync follow/guard/hunt/alert/stationery states server-side; then run a Gradle build to catch regressions.
- 2025-11-19: Keep going—port remaining worldgen/structure data (textual JSON where possible, noting binaries blocked), add README with build/run instructions, then execute Gradle build to verify.
- 2025-11-19 (next): When binary inclusion is allowed, import companion house NBTs under `data/modern_companions/structures/` and wire structure JSON to the new namespace; then run `./gradlew build` to validate.
- 2025-11-19 (future): After binaries are in place, migrate textures/models/lang/sounds, register entity renderers, and perform full runtime testing.
- 2025-11-19 (current): Finish refitting the codebase to the NeoForge 1.21.1 API (ModLoadingContext usage, DeferredHolder registries, SynchedEntityData builder, Animal#isFood overrides, ResourceLocation factories, networking replacements) so `./gradlew build` succeeds.
- 2025-11-19 (up next): Hook up actual entity/client renderers + layers, flesh out AI/GUI actions (release, clear target, patrol radius), and verify functionality in-game now that the build passes.
