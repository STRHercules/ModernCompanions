- 2025-11-18: Next, port original Human Companions content into the new NeoForge 1.21.1 scaffolding—migrate registries (entities/items/structures), networking, configs, and assets under `modern_companions`, then add README and run a full Gradle build once the code is in place.
- 2025-11-18 (later): Finish porting gameplay logic (entities/AI, networking, GUIs, structure placement) onto the new registries; add data-driven assets under the new namespace once binary inclusion is allowed, then verify with a Gradle build.
- 2025-11-18 (further): Next still to-do—port GUI toggle controls and networking for patrol/alert/hunt/stationary flags, migrate companion house worldgen data/logic, and run a full Gradle build/validation once core behaviors are complete.
- 2025-11-18 (network prep): Wire upcoming GUI buttons to the new toggle-flag packet so player interactions sync follow/guard/hunt/alert/stationery states server-side; then run a Gradle build to catch regressions.
- 2025-11-19: Keep going—port remaining worldgen/structure data (textual JSON where possible, noting binaries blocked), add README with build/run instructions, then execute Gradle build to verify.
- 2025-11-19 (next): When binary inclusion is allowed, import companion house NBTs under `data/modern_companions/structures/` and wire structure JSON to the new namespace; then run `./gradlew build` to validate.
- 2025-11-19 (future): After binaries are in place, migrate textures/models/lang/sounds, register entity renderers, and perform full runtime testing.
- 2025-11-19 (current): Finish refitting the codebase to the NeoForge 1.21.1 API (ModLoadingContext usage, DeferredHolder registries, SynchedEntityData builder, Animal#isFood overrides, ResourceLocation factories, networking replacements) so `./gradlew build` succeeds.
- 2025-11-19 (up next): Hook up actual entity/client renderers + layers, flesh out AI/GUI actions (release, clear target, patrol radius), and verify functionality in-game now that the build passes.
- 2025-11-19 (next focus): Playtest companions in a dev world to validate patrol/guard/hunt/alert/stationary behaviors, tune ranged attack AI to newer crossbow/bow mechanics (charging, accuracy, strafing), and consider surfacing XP/level stats plus remaining config toggles in the GUI.
- 2025-11-20: During playtest, confirm the new GUI health/level readouts track correctly, and consider adding patrol radius adjustment + food requirement display. Also evaluate replacing the arbalist's bow-based goal with the 1.21 crossbow behavior (charge/cooldown) for closer parity.
- 2025-11-20 (next): Playtest arbalist crossbow AI for accuracy/charge timing; if too passive, raise attack radius slightly or bias pathfinding while guarding. Add config/GUI control for patrol radius and show current food requirements to help players fulfill taming quickly.
- 2025-11-20 (future polish): Add a slider/text field to choose patrol radius directly and expose a "reset to default" button. Consider adding XP bar + next-level preview in the UI, and a toggle to enable/disable creeper warning per companion.
- 2025-11-20 (following): Now that XP percentage is shown, add a small progress bar graphic and the exact XP needed for next level; also allow exporting/importing companion data via commands for testing.
- 2025-11-20 (later): Consider recoloring the XP bar to match companion class (melee vs ranged) and add tooltip showing total XP and kills; optional toggle to hide the bar for minimal UI.
- 2025-11-20 (inventory stats panel): Fine-tune the new stats panel by adding compact icons/labels for armor, damage, and resistances, and align the sidebar buttons visually with any callouts baked into `inventory_stats.png`; if space allows, add hover tooltips for each stat line.
- 2025-11-21: If the inventory texture ever exceeds 256px in height/width again, centralize texture size constants and add a tiny helper to blit GUIs with explicit atlas dimensions to avoid future wrap issues.
- 2025-11-21 (stats alignment): Add a small helper to render stats with padding derived from the texture so any future layout tweaks only touch constants; consider centering the text block vertically within the stats panel for balance.
- 2025-11-21 (XP sync): If we add more client-side displays (kills, total XP), consider syncing a small stats packet on open to avoid relying on data parameters for everything and to reduce bandwidth.
- 2025-11-21 (inventory growth): Consider adding slot-locking or equipment-only rows to preserve balance now that inventory doubled; or gate extra rows behind higher levels/config to keep early-game companions modest.
- 2025-11-21 (UI polish): If we tweak the background again, consider driving the 1px offsets from constants so different texture revisions can be tested quickly without changing logic.
- 2025-11-21 (pickup toggle): Expose pickup radius/behavior in config (owner-only vs global, magnet strength) and add a quick visual indicator near the button so players know when auto-loot is active.
- 2025-11-21 (RPG stats UI): Surface STR/DEX/INT/END in the companion screen with icons + tooltips, and show any rolled “specialist” bonus so players can see their companion’s build.
- 2025-11-21 (HUD overlays): Add configurable toggle and color-coding for the Jade/WTHIT attribute line (e.g., specialist color), and consider exposing health/XP alongside stats for parity with the inventory panel.
