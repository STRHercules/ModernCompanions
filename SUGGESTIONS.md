- 2025-11-18: Next, port original Human Companions content into the new NeoForge 1.21.1 scaffolding—migrate registries (entities/items/structures), networking, configs, and assets under `modern_companions`, then add README and run a full Gradle build once the code is in place.
- 2025-11-18 (later): Finish porting gameplay logic (entities/AI, networking, GUIs, structure placement) onto the new registries; add data-driven assets under the new namespace once binary inclusion is allowed, then verify with a Gradle build.
- 2025-11-18 (further): Next still to-do—port GUI toggle controls and networking for patrol/alert/hunt/stationary flags, migrate companion house worldgen data/logic, and run a full Gradle build/validation once core behaviors are complete.
- 2025-11-18 (network prep): Wire upcoming GUI buttons to the new toggle-flag packet so player interactions sync follow/guard/hunt/alert/stationery states server-side; then run a Gradle build to catch regressions.
- 2025-11-19: Keep going—port remaining worldgen/structure data (textual JSON where possible, noting binaries blocked), add README with build/run instructions, then execute Gradle build to verify.
- 2025-11-19 (next): When binary inclusion is allowed, import companion house NBTs under `data/modern_companions/structures/` and wire structure JSON to the new namespace; then run `./gradlew build` to validate.
- 2025-11-19 (future): After binaries are in place, migrate textures/models/lang/sounds, register entity renderers, and perform full runtime testing.
- 2025-11-19 (current): Finish refitting the codebase to the NeoForge 1.21.1 API (ModLoadingContext usage, DeferredHolder registries, SynchedEntityData builder, Animal#isFood overrides, ResourceLocation factories, networking replacements) so `./gradlew build` succeeds.
- 2025-11-19 (up next): Hook up actual entity/client renderers + layers, flesh out AI/GUI actions (release, clear target, patrol radius), and verify functionality in-game now that the build passes.
- 2025-11-19 (next focus): Playtest companions in a dev world to validate patrol/guard/hunt/alert/stationary behaviors, tune ranged attack AI to newer crossbow/bow mechanics (charging, accuracy, strafing), and consider surfacing XP/level stats plus remaining config toggles in the GUI.
- 2025-11-20: During playtest, confirm the new GUI health/level readouts track correctly, and consider adding patrol radius adjustment + food requirement display. Also evaluate replacing the arbalist's bow-based goal with the 1.21 crossbow behavior (charge/cooldown) for closer parity.
- 2025-11-20 (next): Playtest arbalist crossbow AI for accuracy/charge timing; if too passive, raise attack radius slightly or bias pathfinding while guarding. Add config/GUI control for patrol radius and show current food requirements to help players fulfill taming quickly.
- 2025-11-20 (future polish): Add a slider/text field to choose patrol radius directly and expose a "reset to default" button. Consider adding XP bar + next-level preview in the UI, and a toggle to enable/disable creeper warning per companion.
- 2025-11-20 (following): Now that XP percentage is shown, add a small progress bar graphic and the exact XP needed for next level; also allow exporting/importing companion data via commands for testing.
- 2025-11-20 (later): Consider recoloring the XP bar to match companion class (melee vs ranged) and add tooltip showing total XP and kills; optional toggle to hide the bar for minimal UI.
- 2025-11-20 (inventory stats panel): Fine-tune the new stats panel by adding compact icons/labels for armor, damage, and resistances, and align the sidebar buttons visually with any callouts baked into `inventory_stats.png`; if space allows, add hover tooltips for each stat line.
- 2025-11-21: If the inventory texture ever exceeds 256px in height/width again, centralize texture size constants and add a tiny helper to blit GUIs with explicit atlas dimensions to avoid future wrap issues.
- 2025-11-21 (stats alignment): Add a small helper to render stats with padding derived from the texture so any future layout tweaks only touch constants; consider centering the text block vertically within the stats panel for balance.
- 2025-11-21 (XP sync): If we add more client-side displays (kills, total XP), consider syncing a small stats packet on open to avoid relying on data parameters for everything and to reduce bandwidth.
- 2025-11-21 (inventory growth): Consider adding slot-locking or equipment-only rows to preserve balance now that inventory doubled; or gate extra rows behind higher levels/config to keep early-game companions modest.
- 2025-11-21 (UI polish): If we tweak the background again, consider driving the 1px offsets from constants so different texture revisions can be tested quickly without changing logic.
- 2025-11-21 (pickup toggle): Expose pickup radius/behavior in config (owner-only vs global, magnet strength) and add a quick visual indicator near the button so players know when auto-loot is active.
- 2025-11-21 (RPG stats UI): Surface STR/DEX/INT/END in the companion screen with icons + tooltips, and show any rolled “specialist” bonus so players can see their companion’s build.
- 2025-11-21 (HUD overlays): Add configurable toggle and color-coding for the Jade/WTHIT attribute line (e.g., specialist color), and consider exposing health/XP alongside stats for parity with the inventory panel.
- 2025-11-21 (new classes): Playtest the seven new roles to tune numbers—e.g., cap Vanguard projectile DR, scale Berserker cleave with weapon tier, give Beastmaster pet sit/unsit commands, and add cooldown HUD hints for Stormcaller/Alchemist effects so players can anticipate bursts.
- 2025-11-21 (weapons port next): Add Better Combat `weapon_attributes` entries and final textures/models for the new arsenal; revisit bronze gating/repair materials if the external bronze mod exposes proper tags.
- 2025-11-21 (spawn eggs): Now that eggs are registered for the new roles, validate they show in the Spawn Eggs tab and consider a dedicated “Companions” creative tab for easier discovery.
- 2025-11-21 (weapon assets): After pulling in BasicWeapons textures/models and bettercombat attributes, playtest with Better Combat enabled to ensure reach/animation feel match upstream; consider adding repair ingredients (bronze tag) once the dependency API is confirmed.
- 2025-11-21 (taming variety): Add per-class taming preference weights (e.g., Vanguard likes ingots more, Alchemist prefers gems) and surface current taming progress in the companion tooltip or GUI so players know how many items remain.
- 2025-11-21 (egg art): If we keep gem-style eggs, consider theming colors to match class UI tinting (e.g., tank blues, healer golds) or swap to class weapon icons later; add a simple glow/outline variant for higher-tier spawn items if desired.
- 2025-11-21 (legacy egg gems): Confirm the four original classes render with their new Gem_7–Gem_10 icons and adjust hues if they clash with the new roles; a single palette map in docs would help keep future assignments consistent.
- 2025-11-21 (kill tracker): Consider surfacing total kills alongside XP in Jade/WTHIT overlays and adding milestones (e.g., cosmetic badges) at certain thresholds to reward long-lived companions.
- 2025-11-21 (beastmaster pets): Add a HUD/icon in the companion screen to show pet status/cooldown and a manual "recall pet" action so players can resync or dismiss the wolf without waiting on the automatic respawn timer.
- 2025-11-21 (pet variety): Expose a config to tune Beastmaster pet weights (e.g., turn off hoglin/polar bear rolls, boost cats/foxes) and surface the current pet type/rarity in the GUI tooltip.
- 2025-11-21 (pet follow): Consider showing a small “following” indicator on the pet and let owners toggle sit/follow like wolves (even for non-tamable mobs) via a right-click or GUI button tied to the Beastmaster.
- 2025-11-21 (pet defense): Add a brief on-hit VFX/SFX when a pet switches to defend the Beastmaster/owner, and expose a config toggle for whether pets may retaliate against neutral mobs the player accidentally hits.
- 2025-11-21 (pet anti-rubberband): Make the follow/teleport grace configurable (hold time + start distance) so pack makers can tune how long pets stay engaged before snapping back.
- 2025-11-21 (pet damage): Consider scaling pet damage by Beastmaster level or weapon tier and surfacing a small damage number/crit indicator to confirm hits from passive mobs.
- 2025-11-21 (pet ownership UI): Add a compact owner/pet status widget with a manual "Bind/Recall Pet" button so players can reattach or retame a Beastmaster pet without waiting for automatic respawn.
- 2025-11-21 (pet spawn FX): Add a brief summon particle/SFX when the Beastmaster’s starting pet appears so players notice the companion instantly and can confirm it spawned correctly.
- 2025-11-21 (pet roster config): Expose a data/config toggle to adjust Beastmaster pet weights (or disable specific mobs) so pack makers can curate allowed pets without code edits.
- 2025-11-21 (pet type UI): Show the locked-in pet type in the Beastmaster’s UI/Jade line and add a manual “respec” token/config gate in case players want to reroll a companion’s pet species.
- 2025-11-21 (respawn diagnostics): Add a small debug/config toggle to log pet respawn failures and the chosen type id to help catch future edge cases without needing code changes.
- 2025-11-21 (pet-specific tuning): Add per-pet-type movement/attack tuning (config or data-driven) so pandas/camels/etc. can be balanced independently without hardcoding values.
- 2025-11-21 (pet lifecycle polish): Consider a small VFX/SFX on Beastmaster death pet-despawn and pet-respawn to signal the lifecycle changes to players.
- 2025-11-21 (spawn init auditing): Add a small helper/log to confirm finalizeSpawn results per pet type (genes/attributes) to quickly diagnose any future mob-specific spawn quirks.
- 2025-11-21 (lost pet UX): After the grace period, consider showing a brief "recalling pet" toast so players know a new pet is on the way instead of assuming it is gone forever.
- 2025-11-21 (untamed handling): Add a config toggle to allow/disable pet spawning for untamed companions in case some packs prefer pets only after hiring.
- 2025-11-21 (camel tuning): Consider a small stamina/step-height tweak for camels so their larger model doesn’t snag on terrain when keeping pace.
- 2025-11-21 (camel pacing): If camels still feel fast/slow, expose their speed multiplier in config alongside pandas to let pack makers tune individually.
- 2025-11-21 (wander tuning): Consider a small configurable idle-wander radius per pet type instead of fully removing wander, to keep them lively without rubber-banding.
- 2025-11-21 (friendly fire config): If desired, expose a toggle allowing friendly-fire for specific pet types (for pack scenarios where shared damage interactions are needed).
- 2025-11-21 (name pool config): Consider moving pet name list to JSON/config so pack makers can theme names or localize more easily.
- 2025-11-21 (nameplate toggle): Add a config to choose always-visible vs hover-only pet nameplates for players who prefer constant labels.
- 2025-11-21 (kill credit UX): Surface pet-kill contributions in the GUI/Jade overlay so players can see which kills came from their beasts.
- 2025-11-21 (scaling tuning): Expose per-attribute multipliers (attack/health/speed) in config so pack makers can tune how strongly pets scale with STR/DEX/END.
- 2025-11-22 (XP tuning): Expose the new MMO-style XP curve constants (base, scale, exponent) in config and surface next-level XP + total XP earned in the companion UI so pack makers can rebalance progression without code edits.
- 2025-11-22 (resurrection flow): Gate activated scrolls behind an advancement/recipe unlock, add an owner-check when reviving to prevent griefing, and make the activation cost configurable (extra reagents, durability loss, or cooldown) while keeping inventory retention opt-in.
- 2025-11-22 (smithing UX): Add a custom smithing template item so players aren’t forced to burn any template for scroll activation, and expose a recipe unlock advancement to teach the template requirement in-game.
- 2025-11-22 (pack format guard): Add a small build check to keep `pack.mcmeta` pack_format aligned with the target Minecraft version so data tags can’t silently be ignored.
