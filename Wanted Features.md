# Wanted Features

1. More skins.

2. Beastmaster Wolfs are duplicating after a reload (FIXED)
    2a. Beastmaster Wolfs should have their owners be the Beastmaster, not the player.
    2b. Add more pets to beastmaster pet pool. (DONE)
    2c. Vary beast stats according to master
    2d. Every beastmaster should have a 'type' assigned to them so when their pet respawns, it respawns the same 'type' every time.
    2e. Beasts should say who their beastmaster owner is on their WTHIT/Jade
    2f. Beastmasters can never damage their own pets.
    2g. Beasts should have randomized names.
    2h. Beast kills should count towards master killcount.

3. Dedicated area for equipped gear (paperdoll)

4. Better follow mechanics
    6a. Patrol doesnt seem to work
    6b. Companions seem to just bounce back and forth to and from the player
    6c. Beastmaster wolfs seem to rubberband between the player and the beastmaster - they should ONLY be following the beastmaster.

5. Resurrection - revive dead companions?

6. Mule Companion - Larger inventory? Avoids combat?

7. Alter EXP Curve for Companions, higher level = more exp required (MMPORPG Style)

8. Way to summon/dismiss companion entirely
    8a. Convert entity to item, then item back to entity?
