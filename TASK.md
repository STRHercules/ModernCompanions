Let's extend the amount of 'classes' these companions can be. 

I want to add:

1. Vanguard / Shieldbearer
Role: Pure tank / bodyguard
Theme: “I stand between you and death.”

* Uses: Shield + sword (but less damage, more mitigation than Knight).
* Traits:
    * Focuses on taunting or prioritizing anything targeting the player.
    * Extra projectile damage reduction (arrows, tridents, ghast fireballs).
    * Could passively give nearby allies a small damage resistance aura.

2. Berserker
Role: High-risk melee DPS
Theme: Stronger the lower their health is.

* Uses: Axe/Sword.
* Traits:
    * Gains bonus damage the lower their HP gets.
    * Slightly reduced armor, but high knockback resistance.
    * Can cleave multiple opponents regardless of weapon.

3. Hunter / Beastmaster
Role: Ranged + pet synergy
Theme: Companion who fights alongside tamed animals.

* Uses: Bow or crossbow, plus a pet (wolf, fox, or custom).
* Traits:
    * Deals bonus damage vs beasts (wolves, hoglins, etc.).
    * Has a chance to buff nearby tamed animals (speed or damage).
    * If their pet dies, maybe they get a temporary rage buff.
    * A Hunter/Beastmaster's pet cannot permanently die. They will always respawn after death after a short time.

4. Cleric
Role: Healer / holy support
Theme: Totem/potion-based healing & anti-undead.

* Uses: Totem of Undying, glowstone dust, or golden items as visual theme.
* Traits:
    * Periodically heals nearby allies (you + companions) when they drop under a threshold.
    * Deals bonus damage to undead mobs (zombies, skeletons, drowned, etc.).
    * Might occasionally cast a short regen or resistance aura.

5. Alchemist
Role: Potion support / soft control
Theme: Snack-throwing chaos goblin.

* Uses: Splash potions as main weapon.
* Traits:
    * Throws healing / regen potions at allies when they’re low.
    * Throws weakness, slowness, or poison at enemies.
    * Could have a small chance to “upgrade” potion effects (e.g. strength I → strength II for a shorter time).

6. Scout / Skirmisher
Role: Mobility & hit-and-run
Theme: Quick, annoying, and hard to pin down.

* Uses: Short sword / dagger (retextured tool).
* Traits:
    * Higher movement speed & jump height, reduced fall damage.
    * Prefers to dart in, hit once or twice, then reposition.
    * Maybe bonus damage when attacking from behind or while target is focused on someone else.

7. Stormcaller
Role: Burst / high-cooldown strikes
Theme: Lightning and weather.

* Uses: Trident.

* Traits:
    * On a cooldown, can call a lightning strike on a marked target (amplified damage in rain/storm).
    * Might slightly boost your trident channeling/lightning interactions if nearby.
    * Great “hero moment” companion – not constant, but impactful.
